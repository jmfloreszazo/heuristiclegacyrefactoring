## What is HLR?  
**Heuristic Legacy Refactoring (HLR)** is an approach to modernizing legacy systems that combines **heuristics**, **objective metrics**, and **strategic refactoring**.  
The goal is to **reduce technical debt**, **improve maintainability**, and **prepare existing systems for future evolution**, guided by data rather than intuition.

## Principles of HLR  

1. **Evidence over intuition**  
   Refactoring decisions are based on quantitative metrics (complexity, coupling, maintainability) rather than vague perceptions.  

2. **Iteration over rewriting**  
   Legacy systems are improved step by step, reducing risk, instead of discarding everything and starting from scratch.  

3. **Mapping to understand**  
   Every process begins with a clear assessment of the system: dependencies, hotspots, accumulated technical debt.  

4. **Refactoring to modernize**  
   Refactoring is not an end in itself but a means to enable technological and architectural evolution.  

5. **Long-term sustainability**  
   Technical debt must be measured and managed continuously to avoid falling back into unmaintainable systems.

## Values of HLR  

- **Clarity over complexity**  
  Favor simple systems with clear responsibilities and well-defined boundaries.  

- **Data over opinions**  
  Rely on objective metrics as the compass for refactoring.  

- **Incremental progress over big leaps**  
  Step-by-step modernization builds confidence and delivers visible results.  

- **Collaboration over isolated decisions**  
  Knowledge of the system is shared, and refactoring should involve the whole team.  

- **Continuous evolution over one-time modernization**  
  The goal is not a single milestone but a sustained practice that keeps software alive and adaptable.

## Benefits of applying HLR  

- Identification of **critical hotspots** in the system before major changes.  
- Objective prioritization of what to refactor and in which order.  
- Reduced risk of failures during modernization.  
- Gradual preparation for more modular, scalable, and resilient architectures.  
- Building a culture of **continuous improvement**.

## How to start with HLR  

1. **Analyze the system** with heuristic tools to identify structure and risks.  
2. **Collect key metrics**: complexity, coupling, technical debt.  
3. **Identify hotspots**: the components that concentrate the greatest risk.  
4. **Refactor in short cycles**: simplify, reduce dependencies, extract responsibilities.  
5. **Integrate metrics into CI/CD** to measure progress and stay on course.

Inspired by the need to modernize legacy systems in a way that is **intelligent, measurable, and sustainable**.
